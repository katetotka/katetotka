- 👋 Hi guys, I’m @katetotka!!
- 👨‍🎓 I have studied Ιnternational and European Relations and now I am pursuing my master's degree in Business Analytics and Data Science.
- 🌌🪐 The truth about me is that I am a space traveller. When I close my eyes I travel with my galaxy bike to all the fairytale places of Milky Way! But one day, as I was
returning home from Mars a sudden stellar storm took me off my path and I found myself in a parallel universe where everything needed data to work. I was fascinated by the way the
inhabitants of this universe used data to make data-driven decisions and improve their standard way of living! When I turned back home, I was thinking completely different!
I also wanted to be able to harness the enormous power of data and so I began to explore day by day every aspect of this field of science!
- 📊 Now, I am working as a Data Engineer at Accenture and I feel that I am one step closer to making my dream come true and becoming a data scientist!
- ✨ So, I am here to build and share my own projects with you. Wish each of my projects to offer me even more knowledge and experience!
